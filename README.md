# AR_Boardgame

This is my implementation of the popular card board game BANG!. The game is based on 3 systems: turn, life, distance.
Turn system:
- each player can play any card while his turn is still active
- after finishing the turn, he can pass it to the player next to him
Life system:
- players will gain a life when he plays BEER card or SALOON card
- players will lose a life when they are under attack with BANG card, and they don't have MISSED card to defend themselves
- players will lose a life when they are under attack with INDIANS card, and they don't have a BANG card to defent themselves
Distance system:
- each player can attack only the players that are in his range
- the player can increase his range by equiping a weapon
Other implementations:
- each player can have a special charcacter. The ones implemented in this project are: Bart, El Gringo, Paul, Rose, Willy. More information about these character here: https://www.ultraboardgames.com/bang/the-characters.php
- the game is implemented with augmented reality
